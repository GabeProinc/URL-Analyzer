# URL Analyzer by GabeProInc

Hey there! Welcome to the **URL Analyzer**, a friendly and intuitive tool crafted by GabeProInc on September 08, 2025, to help you peek under the hood of any website. Whether you're curious about what makes a site tick or just want to explore its details, this app is designed to make the process simple, clear, and even a little fun!

## What It Does
Imagine you’re exploring a new city, and you want to know all about a specific building—its history, who owns it, and what’s inside. That’s what URL Analyzer does for websites! Just type in a website address (like `example.com`), hit the "Analyze Website" button, and watch as the app uncovers a treasure trove of info, neatly organized into three easy-to-read tabs:

- **Overview**: Get the big picture—see the website’s title, a short description, who created it, where the server is located (like a city and country for the site’s "home"), how fast it loads, and fun facts like how many words or images are on the page. It even checks if the site has a logo (favicon) or special files for search engines.
- **Links**: Discover where the website connects to, both within itself (internal links) and to other sites (external links). It shows you a handful of examples so you can see what’s linked without getting overwhelmed.
- **WHOIS & SSL**: Dive into the website’s "paperwork"—who owns the domain, when it was created, and when it expires. Plus, it checks if the site has a security certificate (like a digital lock) to keep your connection safe.

## Why It’s Awesome
We built this app to feel like chatting with a knowledgeable friend who explains techy stuff in plain English. No confusing jargon here! The interface is sleek and modern, with a clean design that works in light or dark mode, depending on your vibe. If something goes wrong (like a bad URL), the app gently lets you know with a clear message and a handy error code, so you’re never left scratching your head.

## Who’s It For?
Whether you’re a curious beginner, a small business owner checking out a competitor’s site, or just someone who loves learning about the web, URL Analyzer is for you. It’s perfect for anyone who wants to understand a website without needing a tech degree.

## How to Use It
1. Download the app and install the required tools (a quick `pip install requests beautifulsoup4 python-whois customtkinter` will do the trick).
2. Run `url_analyzer_gui.py` with Python.
3. Type a website URL into the box (with or without `https://`—we’ve got you covered).
4. Click "Analyze Website" and explore the results in the tabs!
